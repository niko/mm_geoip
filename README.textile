h1. MMGeoip

h2. DISCLAIMER: WORK IN PROGRESS!

A proxy object around the geoip gem for lazy lookup. Includes a Rack middleware.

* Rack::MMGeoip exposes all Maxmind properties: hostname, ip, country_code, country_code3, country_name, country_continent, region, city, postal_code, lat, lng, dma_code, area_code, timezone
* Rack::MMGeoip pins a MMGeoipProxy to your environment and does the loopup lazy when you first access a geoip property.
* Rack::MMGeoip looks for the standard geoip headers and wraps their access, too. So if you're adding these header with mod_geoip in Apache or with http_geoip_module in NGinX these headers are used. So you can use this middleware even in production without compromising performance if NGinX or Apache already add these headers.

h2. Performance

Rack::MMGeoip uses the geoip gem. In my tests this lib did about 17_000 lookups in about 17 seconds on my MBP, so you probably lose one ms per request when using the middleware.
